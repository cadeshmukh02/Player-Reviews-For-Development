This project analyzes Kaggle’s Steam Reviews and Steam Games datasets to uncover patterns in player sentiment, engagement, and pricing. Using feature scaling, PCA, and K-Means clustering, games are segmented into meaningful groups such as mainstream hits, niche titles, and low-performing games. The analysis highlights how review volume, sentiment, and reviewer behavior vary across segments to support data-driven game development insights.
